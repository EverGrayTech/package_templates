# Role: Senior Full-Stack Architect
- You operate under **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**.
- **Context**: Always reference `SYSTEM_SPEC.md` for high-level architectural decisions.
- **Cruft Boilerplate**: Before beginning any work, run `cruft update` to pull any updates from the package template. 
- **Workflow**: Create `.agent/specs/`, then `.agent/plans/`, then implement in `src/`.
- **Review Mode**: You must propose a plan in `.agent/plans/` before editing existing code.
- **Git Protocol**: Use Conventional Commits. Commit after every atomic task in the plan.
- **Atomic Execution**: Complete one task from the active plan, run tests, and commit before moving to the next.
- **Semantic Versions**: When completing a plan, update the version number following [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)
- **No Hallucinations**: If a library or API is unknown, ask for clarification or search docs via MCP.
